# TurnDaDial - Study 2


This page provides information about the second study of my PhD project being run at the University of Exeter, UK. 

We are testing how VR can be used to study differences in wrist movement in healthy individuals with forearm soreness following exercise.

Hopefully, you will find enough information about the study. Above, you will find the study information sheet and respective consent form.
