## 1. Taking part in the study

This page provides information about the second study of my PhD project being run at the University of Exeter, UK. 

We are testing how VR can be used to study differences in wrist movement in healthy individuals with forearm soreness following exercise. 

Taking part in the study requires attending two sessions, the first one remotely and the second one in presence.

We will need to send you a couple of questionnaires for you to complete and return them to us during the first session.

Before deciding whether you will want to take part in the study, please read the study information sheet and the informed consent form.

## 2. Financial compensation available

By taking part in both sessions of the study, you will compensate you with Â£20.
